# stagedpipeline
StagedPipeline is a javascript library with which you can easily implement a staged pipeline. It's aimed to be easy to use. A staged pipeline allows you to create stages and gain control over the order in which your callbacks will be executed. Stages will never be executed in parallel, callbacks assigned to one stage will alway be executed in parallel
